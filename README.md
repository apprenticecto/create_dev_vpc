# Create A Development VPC

In this repo (link to create-aws-ec2-repo) we created an ec2 to the VPC default VPC (link)

Now we0ll make use of Terraform modules to create our development VPC, eee we'll launch an EC2 instance.

This slightly more complex configuration makes use of the following concepts:
 - Terraform modules (link)
 - Terraform input variables (link)


Consider adding tests
